"# Sudoku-Solver" 
Can solve easy (eg. http://www.sudokudragon.com/dailyeasy.php) to hard (eg https://www.websudoku.com/?level=3) Sudoku puzzles, but cannot solve puzzles that require randomization or advanced permutation strategies. 

TODOs: 
- create UI wrapper so easy to play with from command line.
- clean up code/readability
- Include more advanced strategies 
- Add test cases
- Add testing for invalid sudoku problems, eg. my solution here. https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/description/
- Find/interface with good API so less manual testing is needed
